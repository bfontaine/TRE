# TRE Algopol

Note: This repository is online for achiving purposes, most of what's needed to
build some parts of it (e.g. the report/slides) is not included here. The final
slides deck is
[available on Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/bfontaine/soutenance-tre).

This work was done between February and June 2014.
